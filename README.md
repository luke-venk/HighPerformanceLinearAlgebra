## Compilation instructions
In order to simplify compilation, building, and ensuring the program runs on the correct number of threads, we decided to use a build script called build.sh.

In order to run the program, create a new terminal. Navigate to the project root directory, and enter the following:

*chmod +x build.sh*
*./build.sh*

--
The program has a UI that asks the user how large the matrices should be, as well as whether they would like the computation to use parallelization or not.
